# olympic-data-analysis-dashboard
I built an Olympic Data Analysis Dashboard with features including medal tally, overall analysis, country-wise analysis, and athlete-wise analysis. Users can select specific years and countries to tailor the insights. The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of Olympic data, helping users explore trends and performance.
